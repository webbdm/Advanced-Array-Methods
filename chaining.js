// Using one single line of JavaScript code, complete the following tasks on the array of integers below.

// 1.  Sort the numbers in descending order (10, 9, 8, 7, etc).
// 2.  Remove any integers greater than 19.
// 3.  Multiply each remaining number by 1.5 and then subtract 1.
// 4.  Then output (either in the DOM or the console) the sum of all the resulting numbers.

var integers = [13, 25, 6, 3, 11, 2, 18, 7, 21, 1, 29, 20, 12, 8];
